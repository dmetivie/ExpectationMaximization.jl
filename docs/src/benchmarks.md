# Benchmarks

I plan to add benchmarks similar to [here](https://floswald.github.io/post/em-benchmarks/).
However, I am not too sure how to do 100% fair comparisons across languages.

Obviously I would test only Gaussian Mixture since it is the most common type of mixture (remembering that this packages allow plenty of mixtures).
